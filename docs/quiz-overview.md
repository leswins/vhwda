# Quiz Overview (Client-Friendly)

This quiz is a friendly way to learn what kinds of health careers fit a person best. It asks simple questions, turns the answers into a “preference profile,” and then compares that profile to real careers in the catalog. The result is a short list of careers that feel like a good match.

## What the quiz is trying to learn

Think of the quiz like a conversation:

- What kinds of tasks do you enjoy? (working with people, using tools, analyzing data)
- What kind of pace do you want? (steady vs. fast)
- What environments do you prefer? (hospital, clinic, lab, school)
- What limits do you have? (can’t do heavy lifting, can’t work nights)
- How much education are you willing to do?
- What pay level do you need to start?

## How answers become a “preference profile”

Every answer adds or subtracts points for different preferences. These are small numbers from **-2 to +2**:

- **+2** = “I strongly like this”
- **0** = “I’m neutral”
- **-2** = “I strongly dislike this”

The quiz adds up these points across all questions to form a simple profile of what the person likes and avoids.

### Example (simple)

A user says:
- “I like working directly with patients” → +2 toward patient-facing work  
- “I prefer a predictable schedule” → +2 toward routine pace  
- “I don’t want heavy lifting” → this becomes a hard limit (explained below)

By the end, we get a clear, balanced profile that reflects what the person actually wants.

## How careers are compared to the user

Every career in the catalog also has a profile that describes its “ideal fit.” The quiz compares the user’s profile to each career profile and finds the closest matches.

### Example (realistic)

**Career: Medical Assistant**  
Typical profile in the catalog:  
- Strong patient-facing work  
- Clinic setting  
- Medium pace  
- Some hands-on procedures  

If the user’s answers show “I like working with people,” “I’m okay with clinics,” and “I want hands-on tasks,” then the Medical Assistant career naturally scores high.

**Career: Medical Lab Technician**  
Typical profile in the catalog:  
- Lab environment  
- More analytical work  
- Limited direct patient contact  

If the user says “I enjoy lab work and data,” this career will rank higher than patient-heavy roles.

## Hard limits (deal-breakers)

Some questions act like *non‑negotiables*. If a user says “no” to a deal‑breaker, careers that require that condition are excluded.

### Examples

- If the user says **“I cannot do heavy lifting”**, careers that require lifting are removed.
- If the user says **“I can’t work nights or weekends”**, careers that require nights/weekends are removed.
- If the user says **“I’m not willing to complete licensure”**, careers that require licensure are removed.

This protects the user from getting matched to jobs they simply can’t or won’t do.

## Education and pay filters

The quiz also asks about:

- **Maximum education willing to complete**  
- **Minimum starting salary needed**

These are used as filters, not “scores.”

### Example

If a user says:
- “I’m only willing to complete a certificate or shorter program”  
Then careers that require a bachelor’s or graduate degree are filtered out.

If a user says:
- “I need at least $40,000 starting salary”  
Then careers with lower starting pay are filtered out.

## Why this feels fair to users

The system is built to reflect *both* preferences and limits:

- Preferences shape the ranking  
- Limits remove unrealistic options  
- The final list feels personalized, not random  

## What the client should expect to see

At the end of the quiz, users see:

- A short list of top‑matching careers  
- Matches that align with their interests, environment, and lifestyle  
- Fewer “bad fit” results because deal‑breakers and filters already removed them  

## Quick story example (ELI5)

Imagine the quiz is a friendly match‑maker:

“You told me you like working with people, want a clinic, prefer a steady pace, and can’t work nights.  
So I won’t show you Emergency Room jobs.  
I will show you roles like Medical Assistant or Dental Assistant that fit your answers.”

That’s the core idea: **listen to the person, then match them to real careers that fit.**
